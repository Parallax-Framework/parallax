# Parallax Framework

**Parallax** is a lightweight, modular roleplay framework for Garry's Mod designed from the ground up to provide stable, dynamic, and immersive roleplay experiences. Built with performance, organization, and developer control in mind, Parallax avoids the bloat and legacy issues of traditional frameworks while offering a solid foundation for any roleplay scenario.

Whether you're creating a Half-Life universe roleplay, military simulation, modern city roleplay, or something entirely unique, Parallax provides the tools and architecture to bring your vision to life.
