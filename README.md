# Parallax Framework

Parallax is a lightweight, modular roleplay framework for Garry's Mod. It has been developed from scratch to deliver performance, simplicity, and total customizability for serious roleplay worlds, and ease of extension and maintenance.

## Features

- Modular and clean design
- SQLite and MySQL hybrid support
- Custom user interface system
- Weight-based inventory system
- Schema-driven item, faction, and class registration

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Before you push your changes, ensure that:

- Your code is in proper format and documentation
- You have well-tested changes for both singleplayer and multiplayer modes
- You include proper LDoc comments for new functions or modules

## Framework Integrity

If you see any code that appears to be cut and pasted directly from another framework or uncannily similar to externally derived content, **please open an issue immediately**. We would like to uphold the integrity and originality of Parallax and will give all reports serious consideration.

All changes I (bloodycop6385) make, are done on the `x86-64` branch.
